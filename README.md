# Lattice Gauge Theory practice
---
** This toolkit is currently under construction. **

## Update note
Ultimate target is to make package generic to all gauge type involving lattice.
To achieve this, field initialization and action must be imporved.
However, by persuing generality, algorithms could not be optimized.
